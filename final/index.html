            On July 5th, 1852, Frederick Douglass stood before an audience in Rochester, New York, and delivered one of
            the most powerful speeches in American history: “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?” In a nation
            celebrating its independence and freedom, Douglass brought the contradiction between the "Land of the Free"
            and slavery.

        <p>
            Frederick starts his legendary speech by comparing the founding of the country to the its current state.
            He mentions that "76 years years ago, the people of this country were British subjects... You were 
            under the British Crown. "
