                "Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. 
                The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. 
                The <Semibold>rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence</Semibold>, bequeathed by your fathers, 
                is shared by you, not by me. 
                The <Semibold>sunlight</Semibold> that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me."

                but it is a day of mourning for slaves. He mentions that white people inherit the core values that the
                Founding Fathers believed in, while slaves are stuck dying in the "sunlight" given by the day.
