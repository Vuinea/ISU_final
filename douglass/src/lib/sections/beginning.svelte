        On July 5th, 1852, Frederick Douglass stood before an audience in Rochester, New York, and delivered one of
            the most powerful speeches in American history: “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?” In a nation

            and slavery to the public. Explore this website to learn what happens as well as
